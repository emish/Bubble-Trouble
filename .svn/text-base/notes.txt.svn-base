Notes for Bubble Trouble in OAT

---------------------
   Task List 
---------------------
* = doing now
** = partial
*** = done

   **0. Bubble physics: Make bubble bounce. Trajectory changes by incrementing y 1 more than before each time. x always
      incremented by 1.
   
   *1. Collision detection: 
      ***1a. Add collision detection for entire harpoon rope, not just tip. This can be done by 
   incorporating the sizey of the harpoon. 
      **1b. Incorporate the whole bubble size into collision detection, some clever way of approximating
   the circular shape, instead of using a bounding box. Might just do bounding box for simplicity.
   (checking if the character is not empty)
       		- ***Collision with walls
		- ***Collision with harpoon
       ***1c. Split big bubbles into small bubbles until smallest, then just pop.
       **1d. Collision detection between bubble and guy.   

   **2. Add stage and scene decorations/components: 
      - Walls
      - Ceiling
      - Floor
      - Lives counter
      - Stage 
      - Maybe add walls n shit for newer stages, this is complex.
      - Title screen

   **3. How to incorporate different "stages" ? Perhaps just randomly choose a new bubble size, or add an additional 
      number of bubbles. 
      Describe 'level' as follows: 
      	       - num_small_bubbles: 
	       - num_med_bubbles: 
	       - num_big_bubbles:
	       - num_biggest_bubbles:
      So, every time a stage completes: 
      	  num_med_bubbles = num_med_bubbles + 1 % 4
	  if (num_med_bubbles == 0) 
	     num_big_bubbles = num_big_bubbles + 1 % 3
      	  if (num_med_bubbles == 0 & num_big_bubbles == 0) 
	     num_biggest_bubbles = num_biggest_bubbles + 1 % 2 


	     Just use bubble trouble from online as example. Grid out
	     some basic points on the stage using the border and x,y
	     distances.
	     Use those to place bubbles. 

    ***4. Create character bitmap. 
    	   *** - left and right movement animation 
    
    5. Incorporate power-ups.
       a. Can fire multiple harpoons for limited time.
       b. Can fire lasers
       c. Increased movement speed
       d. Extra life
       
   6. Animations: 
      - ***Character moving right and left
      - Bubbles popping (add extra frame, create new bitmap for "pop")
      - Character death/collision. Add circular frame, and color out rest of stage for effect. 

   7. Game State: 
      - **Loss of life.
      - **Restarting level.
      - **Progression of levels.
      - ***Updating time/lives.

   Random notes and bugs: 
----------------------------------

might want to add border dimensions to all game-objects, not just the stage. 

guy goes off edges. **FIXED**

harpoon overshoots barrier because we added the guy's height to draw. **FIXED**

bubbles overshoot the floor because the dy makes them increment y by more than 1, so collision isn't detected until
after they have surpassed the y-value of the floor. Fix this by checkin during the addition, if the result will be greater than the 
floor y value, then just set the y to be the y floor value instead. **FIXED**

Bubbles go off the stage if hit near a wall.
